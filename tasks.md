# Tasks

## TODO
* Responses are not handeled correctly for MULTIs.
* Implement response handling for TEXTs.
* When I get to the end of the questionnaire, it should display a message and a submit-button.
* While filling out the questionnaire, I want to see a progress indicator.
* When submitting the questionnaire, it is marked as completed, and further changes cannot be done.
* I want to navigate the questionnaire using the keyboard.

## REFACTOR
* Touched should be a map, not an attribute on Question.

## DONE
* At the first question, the "go-to-previous" keys and buttons should be disabled.
* For debugging purposes, display responses in log or on screen.
